## ScrumMD

**A note before we start: I'm proud of how much is done, but if you've stumbled here before I've told folk about it, it's not _quite_ ready, and I'm not accepting contributions just yet. There's a couple more big changes I want to do before it's released. I will still gladly take feedback.**

**ScrumMD** started with a question: What if we could have a scrum board driven entirely by md files and the CLI, and use it with git?

I know that it's going to be of niche use, but it opens up a number of great ways to do the scrum process. For instance:

-   You can run standup for `sprint1` with:

```bash
vim `sbl -b sprint1`
```

-   You can manage your cards with git...
-   ... and can add them in the repository that they are for
-   It's all text - so integrate with whatever you want
