Status: Ready
---

# Description

When a `tags` or `collections` field is present, it should also be added to those collections for the sake of `sbl` and other commands.

If there is a property styled field, it should accept `;` or `,` to separate them.

If there is a header style field, it should accept one tag per line, starting with `-` ('bullet-point list style')

# Cucumber

**GIVEN** a `tags` or `collection` field
**WHEN** `sbl` is run with one of its members as the collection
**THEN** the card is shown
