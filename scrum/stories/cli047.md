Summary: Set cli command specific configs per collection
Status: Ready
---

# Description

Initial goal was to be able to set default templates for specific collections - but this opens up more posibilities.

Extends [[cli024]] to support `collections.<collection>.<command>` sections.

In the event of a clash (for instance, to the `scard` template) the implicit path collection in the card is used.

## Example

```toml
[tool.scrummd.collections.story.scard]
default_md = "story_default_md.j2"
