Summary: Add caching of files
Status: Not fully defined
---

# Description

When there's significant amounts of files (1000+), operations slow down as most
queries require that all cards are loaded from XML on the filesystem. We are
going to create a sqlite db in the filesystem that stores a searchable, indexed
cache of the current status. When a command is run, we will check if there are
any 'dirty' files, and update the cache, and then perform the command off the
cache.
