# Description

Currently, cards are created manually in a text editor. This is to create an
`snew` command that creates a new card, in a collection, with the next index.

It needs to:

-   Accept optional positional argument `collection` that defined which folder it's in
-   Accept optional argument `--prefix`/`-p` for the prefix to the card, or use the default prefix for the collection
-   Create a prefix config option in the scrum config
-   Create a prefix config option for collections in the scrum config
-   Default to `c` if there is no prefix
-   Create a default template option in the scrum config
-   Create a default template option for colletions in the scrum config
-   Allow mandatory fields to be set with `swrites` `=` syntax
-   Allow the whole card to be piped in to stdin
-   Allow `-e` to open the editor for a new card
