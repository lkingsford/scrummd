# Description

Cards go in `scrum/cards`. Collections go in `scrum/collections`.

By default, all cards are in the inventory. There's no filters being applied at the moment.

For now, a card must have a summary. Other fields are optional. Fields are defined either in obsidian style properties:

```md

or by the text following a hash header with.
